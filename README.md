# Synthetic-Data-Generation-using-Statistical-and-AI-Methods
Designed and implemented two novel methodologies for generating synthetic time series data that maintain the statistical properties found in real-world datasets. Knowledge: Time series analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, data manipulation and analysis tools.
